Maximum Pairwise Product Problem
Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers
in a sequence of non-negative integers.

Input: A sequence of non-negative
integers.
Output: The maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence.

Input format: The first line contains an integer n. The next line contains n non-negative integers a1,...,an (separated by spaces).
Output format: The maximum pairwise product.
Constraints: 2 < n <= 2 . 1e5; 0 <= a1,....,an <= 2 . 1e5.
