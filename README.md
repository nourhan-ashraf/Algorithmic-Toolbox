# Algorithmic-Toolbox
This online course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming.
in this Repo i provide my solutions for the assignments of (algorithmic toolbox) course and (Learning Algorithms Through Programming And Puzzle Solving) book offered by University of California San Diego &amp; HSE University at coursera platform.
