Covering Segments by Points Problem
------------------------------------

Find the minimum number of points needed to cover all given segments on a line.

Input: A sequence of n segments [a1,b1], ... ,[an,bn] on a line.

Output: A set of points of minimum size such that each segment [ai ,bi] contains a point, i.e., there exists a point x such that ai <= x <= bi.


Input format. The first line of the input contains the number n of segments.
Each of the following n lines contains two integers ai and bi (separated by a space) defining the coordinates of endpoints of the i-th segment.

Output format. The minimum number m of points on the first line and the integer coordinates of m points (separated by spaces) on the second line. You can output the points in any order. If there are many such sets of points, you can output any set.

Constraints. 1 <= n <= 100; 0 <= ai <= bi <= 1e9 for all i.
