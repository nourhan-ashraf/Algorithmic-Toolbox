Majority Element Problem
-------------------------
Check whether a given sequence of numbers contains an element that appears more than half of the times.

Input: A sequence of n integers.
Output: 1, if there is an element that is repeated more than n=2 times, and 0 otherwise.


Input format. The first line contains an integer n, the next one contains a sequence of n non-negative integers a(1),...,a(n).

Output format. Output 1 if the sequence contains an element that appears more than n=2 times, and 0 otherwise.

Constraints. 1 <= n <= 1e5; 0 <= ai <= 1e9 for all 1 <= i <= n.


Sample 1:
---------
Input:
5
2 3 9 2 2

Output:
1

2 is the majority element.


Sample 2:
---------
Input:
4
1 2 3 1

Output:
0

This sequence does not have a majority element (note that the element 1 is not a majority element).
